## MultiProcessing and pipes
  We aim to develop a program that can work with multiple processes, manage them, and transfer data among them using pipes. We will use the map-reduce technique for the development of this project.
We use a multiprocessor technique to count duplicate words in files in parallel, and after this step we save the number of duplicate words in a file.
